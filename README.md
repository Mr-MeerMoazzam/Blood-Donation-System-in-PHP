# Blood-Donation-System-in-PHP
An online blood donation database system is designed to build a database of blood donors and blood recipients, which will help in saving lives of those who need blood. HTML and CSS used for frontend and PHP used for backend and connection.
This project was built for Receivers and Hospitals so that a Hospital user may add a blood sample to their blood bank and a Receiver user can request a blood sample. HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript were utilised on the frontend, PHP on the backend, and MySQL for the database.
